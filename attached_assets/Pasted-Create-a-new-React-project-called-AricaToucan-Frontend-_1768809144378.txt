Create a new React project called AricaToucan-Frontend using the React.js template (or create-react-app structure).

Project name / branding: "Arica Toucan - ISO 27001/27002 Compliance SaaS"

Structure the application with:

1. Routing: Use react-router-dom. Create these routes/pages:
   - /login          → Login page
   - /questionnaire/user     → Employee/organization questionnaire
   - /questionnaire/provider → Provider (internal team) questionnaire
   - /report-preview         → User-facing report preview
   - /admin/dashboard        → Admin dashboard for viewing all organizations

2. Navigation: Create a responsive Navbar using react-bootstrap with brand "Arica Toucan" and the following links:
   - Login
   - User Questionnaire
   - Provider Questionnaire
   - Report Preview
   - Admin Dashboard

3. Styling: Install and use bootstrap + react-bootstrap. Make sure the layout is clean and responsive.

4. Page contents (minimum viable implementation):

   Login.js
   - Simple centered form: email + password + "Login" button
   - Header: "Welcome to Arica Toucan"

   UserQuestionnaire.js
   - Title: "Organization Employee Questionnaire"
   - Render 6–8 sample questions as radio buttons / select (Yes/No/Partial/Not Applicable)
   - Example questions:
     1. Does the organization have a documented information security policy? (ISO 27001 Clause 5.2)
     2. Is access to sensitive information restricted based on business needs? (ISO 27002 5.15)
     3. Are all critical systems protected with up-to-date antivirus/malware protection?
     4. Is data encryption used for data at rest and in transit?
     5. Is there a formal incident response plan?
   - Submit button (for now just console.log the answers)

   ProviderQuestionnaire.js
   - Title: "Service Provider / Internal Review Questionnaire"
   - 4–6 questions focused on provider side, e.g.:
     1. Have we completed the automated system scan review?
     2. Have AI-generated gap recommendations been reviewed?
     3. Are remediation timelines agreed with the client?

   ReportPreview.js
   - Mock report layout using Cards
   - Include:
     - Big number: "Compliance Score: 78%"
     - Simple pie chart using react-chartjs-2 (install chart.js + react-chartjs-2)
     - Sections: Strengths, Gaps Identified, Recommended Remedies, Estimated Steps to Compliance

   AdminDashboard.js
   - Title: "Arica Toucan Admin – All Organizations"
   - Responsive Table (react-bootstrap Table) with columns:
     - Organization Name
     - Compliance Score
     - Last Scan Date
     - Status
     - Actions (View Details button)
   - Use mock data (array of 4–6 organizations), example:
     [
       { name: "TechNova Solutions", score: 84, date: "2026-01-15", status: "Partial" },
       { name: "FinSecure Pvt Ltd", score: 62, date: "2026-01-10", status: "Critical Gaps" },
       ...
     ]

5. Add a simple Footer component on all pages: "© 2026 Arica Toucan – Helping organizations achieve & maintain ISO 27001/27002 compliance"

6. GitHub:
